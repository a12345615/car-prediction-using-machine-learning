# car-prediction-using-machine-learning
🚗 Car Price Prediction – Machine Learning Project
📋 Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting car prices using machine learning techniques. The notebook car_price_predictions.ipynb walks through the entire workflow — from data exploration and feature engineering to model training, evaluation and interpretation.

🎯 Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand features impacting car price.

Clean and preprocess raw data (handle missing values, encode categorical features, scale numerical features).

Engineer new features that can improve price prediction accuracy.

Train and compare multiple machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).

Evaluate model performance via metrics (RMSE, MAE, R²) and select the best performing model.

Interpret model outputs and feature importances to provide business insights.

🔍 Key Highlights

Clear depiction of how car attributes (make, model, year, mileage, fuel type, etc.) affect resale value.

Visualization of relationships among features and target variable.

Comparison of different algorithm performances and discussion of trade-offs (bias vs variance, interpretability vs accuracy).

Provision of a trained model ready for deployment / integration into larger applications or prediction pipelines.

🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used

Python – Primary programming language

Key libraries and frameworks:

pandas, numpy — for data manipulation

matplotlib, seaborn, plotly — for data visualization

scikit-learn — for machine learning models, preprocessing and evaluation
